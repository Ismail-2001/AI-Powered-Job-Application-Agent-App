# 🎯 How to Use System Prompts in AI-Powered IDEs

This guide explains how to use the three system prompt files we've created for maximum productivity when working on the AI Job Application Agent project.

---

## 📁 Which Prompt File to Use?

We've created three versions for different use cases:

| File | Best For | Length |
|------|----------|--------|
| **SYSTEM_PROMPT_FOR_IDE.md** | Deep learning, reference, comprehensive understanding | Full (15+ pages) |
| **SYSTEM_PROMPT_QUICK.md** | Quick reference, daily use, fast context loading | Medium (5 pages) |
| **CURSOR_WINDSURF_PROMPT.txt** | Immediate use in Cursor/Windsurf chat | Short (3 pages) |

## 📊 Context Token Management

### Token Limits by IDE
- **Cursor**: ~100K tokens context
- **Windsurf**: ~200K tokens context  
- **Copilot**: ~8K tokens context
- **Claude**: ~200K tokens context
- **ChatGPT**: ~128K tokens context

### Which Prompt to Use Based on Limits

**Large context (100K+):**
→ Use SYSTEM_PROMPT_FOR_IDE.md (full version)

**Medium context (30K-100K):**
→ Use SYSTEM_PROMPT_QUICK.md (condensed)

**Small context (<30K):**
→ Use CURSOR_WINDSURF_PROMPT.txt (minimal)
→ Or manually include only relevant sections

---

## 🔄 Updating Context During Development

As your project evolves, update the system prompts:

```bash
# 1. Edit the relevant prompt file
nano CURSOR_WINDSURF_PROMPT.txt

# 2. Add new patterns, examples, or guidelines
# For example, if you added a new agent:

<new_agent>
CoverLetterGenerator in agents/cover_letter_generator.py
- Generates personalized cover letters
- Uses job analysis + CV data
- 250-300 words, professional tone
</new_agent>

# 3. Save and reload IDE or re-paste context
```

## 🎓 Pro Tips for Maximum Productivity

### Tip 1: Layer Your Context
```
Base layer: .cursorrules / .windsurfrules (always loaded)
Session layer: Paste specific sections when needed
Request layer: Reference specific files in your question
```

### Tip 2: Reference Specific Files
```
❌ "How do I improve the CV customization?"

✅ "Looking at agents/cv_customizer.py, how can I improve 
   the prompt in the customize() method to better match 
   keywords from the job description?"
```

### Tip 3: Incremental Changes
```
Don't ask: "Rewrite the entire CV customizer"

Instead: 
1. "Improve the keyword matching logic"
2. Test
3. "Now improve the achievement quantification"
4. Test
5. Continue iterating
```

### Tip 4: Verify AI Understanding
```
After loading context, ask:
"What are the three main agents in this project and 
what does each one do?"

If AI answers correctly → proceed
If not → re-paste context or clarify
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting Context Issues

### Issue: AI doesn't follow coding standards

**Fix:**
```
Re-emphasize in your request:
"Please follow the code standards from the system prompt, 
including type hints, docstrings, and error handling."
```

### Issue: AI suggests non-production code

**Fix:**
```
Add to your request:
"Remember this is production code for an enterprise system. 
Apply the validation checklist before suggesting."
```

### Issue: AI forgets project structure

**Fix:**
```
Re-paste the <project_context> section from prompt, or
Reference specific files: "In agents/job_analyzer.py, ..."
```

### Issue: Context too large, hitting limits

**Fix:**
```
1. Use CURSOR_WINDSURF_PROMPT.txt (shortest version)
2. Or manually extract only relevant sections
3. For complex tasks, provide context in stages
```
